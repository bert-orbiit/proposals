## Why This Makes the Narrative STRONGER

### The 3-4 Month Sprint (September 2024 – January 2025)

**September 2024:** Left i3 Verticals  
**October 2024:** Co-founded Orbiit Recovery  
**October 2024 – January 2025:** In just 3-4 months, you:

1. **Built production-ready HIPAA-compliant platform**
   - 200+ story points delivered
   - Zero production incidents
   - 95%+ uptime
   - <$500/month operational costs

2. **Created Signal project management system**
   - Purpose-built for AI-native development
   - Coordinates human + AI teams
   - Potential standalone SaaS product

3. **Launched fractional CTO practice**
   - College Decoded client secured
   - Strategic technology advisory services

4. **Developed AI Archetypes Assessment**
   - Research-backed assessment tool
   - Two consulting platforms (askthehuman.com, acceleratinghumans.com)
   - Strategic AI adoption consulting

5. **Secured paid speaking engagements**
   - IIBA BA Development Days
   - Professional speaking fees

6. **Launched 5 professional websites**
   - Primary consulting platforms
   - Thought leadership blog
   - Recent project sites

### Why PE Investors Will Care

**Before (with wrong timeline):**
- "He's been consulting since 2020" → Could be slow, steady side work
- Multiple projects over 3-5 years → Looks normal

**After (with correct timeline):**
- "He did all of this in 3-4 months WHILE co-founding a company" → Holy shit
- Multiple simultaneous initiatives → Proves AI-augmented development isn't just marketing
- "All nighters and 80 hour weeks" → Shows hustle + AI amplification

### The PE Narrative Becomes

**OLD:** "We use AI tools to develop faster"  
**NEW:** "We've proven AI-native development methodology with measurable outcomes: 200+ story points in 10 weeks, zero production incidents, sustained 15-20 points/day velocity, AND launched fractional CTO practice, AI assessment tool, paid speaking career, and five websites—all in 3-4 months. This isn't theory. This is repeatable execution."

## Key Talking Points for CEO (Updated)

### The Compressed Timeline Story
"Bert left i3 Verticals in September 2024 and co-founded Orbiit Recovery in October. In the 3-4 months since, he built a production HIPAA platform, created Signal project management system, launched a fractional CTO practice, developed the AI Archetypes Assessment, secured paid speaking gigs, and launched five professional websites. This compressed timeline proves the AI-augmented development methodology isn't marketing—it's sustained high-velocity execution across multiple simultaneous initiatives."

### What This Proves to PE Investors

1. **Execution Velocity:** Not just fast at one thing—fast at EVERYTHING simultaneously
2. **Capital Efficiency:** All of this accomplished with minimal capital expenditure (<$500/month infrastructure)
3. **Sustainable Methodology:** Signal enables coordination across multiple projects without velocity loss
4. **Defensible IP:** Signal solves coordination problem that traditional tools (Jira, Linear) cannot
5. **De-Risked Founder Risk:** Comprehensive ADR documentation eliminates "CTO as single point of failure"

## Bottom Line

**You initially said:** "I've been a busy boy. A bunch of all nighters and 80 hour weeks."

**The resume now says:** In 3-4 months since leaving i3 Verticals:
- Production HIPAA platform (200+ story points)
- Signal project management system (potential standalone product)
- Fractional CTO practice launched
- AI Archetypes Assessment developed
- Paid speaking engagements secured
- 5 professional websites launched
- Zero production incidents, 95%+ uptime, <$500/month costs

**The PE investor hears:** "This founder doesn't just claim AI makes him 40x more efficient—he proves it by what he's accomplished in 3-4 months. This is sustainable, repeatable, scalable execution with institutional knowledge transfer. We're not betting on a founder who can code fast—we're betting on a methodology that can scale teams."

## What Stays The Same

- All i3 Verticals experience (Jan 2020 - Sept 2024)
- All Fresenius Medical Care experience (Feb 2014 - Oct 2019)
- Education, certifications, affiliations
- Technical proficiencies
- Core Orbiit Recovery narrative and Signal platform details

## Additional Clarifications

**IIBA Leadership & Speaking:**
- **VP of Technology, Nashville Chapter:** 2022 – Present (current role, though exploring transition)
- **BA Development Days (BADD):** Multi-chapter event sponsored by 9 IIBA chapters
  - Not official international IIBA event, but de facto official due to multi-chapter collaboration
  - Makes speaking engagement more impressive: broader reach than single-chapter event
  - Paid speaking on AI-augmented business analysis, technical translation, distributed teams

## Next Steps

**Recommend:** Send **Executive Summary version** (2-page) to CEO with messaging emphasizing the compressed timeline story.

**Why:** PE investors will be MORE impressed by "3-4 months of simultaneous high-velocity initiatives" than they would be by "5 years of steady consulting work." The compressed timeline proves the AI-native development claim with measurable outcomes.

**If PE wants more:** Comprehensive version (8 pages) is ready for technical due diligence deep dive.
