---

## Phase 2: Research & Intelligence Delivery

**Duration:** 3-5 Weeks  
**Gate:** Deliverable Acceptance → Phase 3 Discussion

### Core Analysis (Regardless of Format)

#### Market Intelligence Across:

- Demographics & population growth trajectories
- Weather patterns & climate risk (hail, wind, hurricanes)
- Average roof age & replacement timing by region
- New construction pipeline & building permits
- Insurance regulations, claim rates, reimbursement patterns
- Supplier/Third-Party Logistics (3PL) warehouse proximity
- Local/state regulatory complexity scoring
- Competitive density & market saturation analysis
- 2-day lead response feasibility mapping
- Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) projection models

#### AI-Powered Methods:

    style G fill:#f0fdf4,stroke:#10b981
    style J fill:#fef3c7,stroke:#f59e0b
```

**Key Methods:**
- Multi-source data aggregation (15-20 public/commercial sources)
- Machine Learning (ML) opportunity scoring algorithms
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for regulatory documents
- Geographic optimization for operational constraints
- Competitive landscape web intelligence
- Scenario modeling & sensitivity analysis

**AI Acceleration Advantage:** Traditional consultants require 8-12 weeks for this analysis. AI-powered automation delivers equivalent depth in 3-5 weeks while processing exponentially more data points. This speed advantage translates directly to competitive positioning—enter high-opportunity markets before competitors identify them.
