## Executive Summary

TrussPoint seeks to systematize greenfield market expansion through Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered analysis, as stated by TrussPoint leadership, targeting a potential 6–9× valuation improvement via a repeatable site selection methodology. This engagement delivers strategic market intelligence and decision frameworks—with execution approach determined by discovery findings.

### About Ask the Human

**Ask the Human operates as an AI-accelerated builder studio.**
Where traditional consultants analyze and advise, we build intelligent systems that execute. Every engagement blends strategic insight with hands-on creation—leveraging AI not to replace thinking, but to compress the time between concept and build. The consulting and analysis frameworks exist to ensure what we build is directionally correct, measurable, and ready to scale.

**Hours Included:** 40 hours (2 travel days + 2 on-site + consolidation)

---

## Phase 2: Research & Intelligence Delivery

**Duration:** 3-5 Weeks  
**Gate:** Deliverable Acceptance → Phase 3 Discussion

### Core Analysis (Regardless of Format)

#### Market Intelligence Across:

- Demographics & population growth trajectories
- Weather patterns & climate risk (hail, wind, hurricanes)
- Average roof age & replacement timing by region
- New construction pipeline & building permits
- Insurance regulations, claim rates, reimbursement patterns
- Supplier/Third-Party Logistics (3PL) warehouse proximity
- Local/state regulatory complexity scoring
- Competitive density & market saturation analysis
- 2-day lead response feasibility mapping
- Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) projection models

#### AI-Powered Methods:

    style G fill:#f0fdf4,stroke:#10b981
    style J fill:#fef3c7,stroke:#f59e0b
```

**Key Methods:**
- Multi-source data aggregation (15-20 public/commercial sources)
- Machine Learning (ML) opportunity scoring algorithms
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for regulatory documents
- Geographic optimization for operational constraints
- Competitive landscape web intelligence
- Scenario modeling & sensitivity analysis

Analysis is conducted using a Python-based aggregation pipeline with AI models (OpenAI / Claude) for synthesis, reviewed by human analysts before delivery.

**AI Acceleration Advantage:** Traditional consultants require 8-12 weeks for this analysis. AI-powered automation delivers equivalent depth in 3-5 weeks while processing exponentially more data points. This speed advantage translates directly to competitive positioning—enter high-opportunity markets before competitors identify them.
