## Message for Your CEO

### Recommended Email:

**Subject:** Resume for PE Investor Review - Bert Carroll

**Body:**

"Attached is my 2-page executive resume for PE investor review.

Over the past year since co-founding Orbiit Recovery (October 2024), I've:

- Built production HIPAA platform with zero incidents (custom Django platform for code ownership)
- Created Signal ‚Äì AI-native project management system proving 40-50x cost efficiency
- **Co-founded Substance Use Disorder Foundation (SUDF) and created Digital Recovery Standard certification** ‚Äì establishing professional credibility standards for digital recovery programs (comparable to IIBA establishing standards for Business Analysts). The DRS framework has 70% overlap with SOC 2/HITRUST requirements and generates revenue through three certification tiers ($5K-$50K).
- Launched Accelerating Humans Podcast (11 episodes) with AI-generated pages and immediately implementable tools for each episode
- Launched fractional CTO practice, AI assessment tool, and 10+ websites

The SUDF certification framework demonstrates regulatory expertise (HIPAA, 42 CFR Part 2) and positions strategic thought leadership alongside revenue generation. This sustained execution with zero production incidents proves the methodology is repeatable and capital-efficient.

Let me know if you need any additional materials for the PE discussions."

## Key Talking Points if Asked

### "Tell me about SUDF"
‚úÖ "I co-founded the Substance Use Disorder Foundation and created a certification standard for digital recovery programs‚Äîsimilar to how IIBA established professional standards for Business Analysts. It's a 100-point evaluation framework covering regulatory compliance (HIPAA, 42 CFR Part 2), clinical excellence, and technology security. Three certification tiers generate $5K-$50K per platform. The framework has 70% overlap with SOC 2 Type II and HITRUST, demonstrating regulatory expertise and creating market positioning for Orbiit Recovery and future ventures."

### "What's Signal?"
‚úÖ "Signal is the AI-native project management system I built to coordinate multiple AI coders alongside human developers. Traditional tools like Jira and Linear don't work for AI-augmented workflows‚Äîthey track commits, not productivity. Signal tracks story points, session quality, and enables parallel development streams with zero merge conflicts. It's how we achieved 40-50x cost efficiency and sustained 15-20 story points per day velocity."

### "Had any production incidents?"
‚úÖ "We experienced incidents on the vendor platform (GoHighLevel), which led to the strategic decision to migrate to our own Django platform for full code ownership. Since taking code ownership, zero incidents with 95%+ uptime. The migration demonstrates technical judgment and eliminates vendor dependency risk."

### "What's the podcast about?"
‚úÖ "Accelerating Humans is a weekly podcast on contemporary AI issues and remaining human in an AI world. What makes it unique is we build AI-generated pages for each episode AND create immediately implementable tools listeners can use alongside the content. It's not just talking about AI‚Äîwe're shipping working software with every episode. This demonstrates the AI-native development methodology in action: simultaneous content and software production."

### "Can this scale without you?"
‚úÖ "Signal makes the methodology repeatable, and 23 Architecture Decision Records document the technical decisions and workflows. The AI-native approach is teachable to strategic thinkers rather than requiring expensive senior engineers‚Äîcreating a 4-6x talent cost advantage. I'm also building institutional knowledge through fractional CTO work and speaking engagements, showing the methodology transfers across organizations."
