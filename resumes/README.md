## Talking Points for PE Investors

### "What's SUDF?"
‚úÖ "Co-founded Substance Use Disorder Foundation and created Digital Recovery Standard certification‚Äîcomparable to IIBA establishing standards for Business Analysis. 100-point evaluation framework with three revenue-generating tiers ($5K-$50K). Framework has 70% overlap with SOC 2/HITRUST, demonstrating regulatory expertise."

### "What's Signal?"
‚úÖ "Purpose-built project management system for AI-native development. Traditional tools like Jira don't work for AI-augmented workflows. Signal tracks story points, session quality, and enables parallel development streams. That's how we achieved 40-50x cost efficiency."

### "Had production incidents?"
‚úÖ "We had incidents on vendor platform (GoHighLevel), which led to migrating to custom Django platform for code ownership. Zero incidents since launch on owned infrastructure with 95%+ uptime."

### "What's the podcast?"
‚úÖ "Weekly podcast on AI and remaining human. We build AI-generated pages and immediately implementable tools for each episode‚Äînot just talking about AI, we're shipping working software with every episode."

### "Can this scale?"
‚úÖ "Signal makes it repeatable. 23 Architecture Decision Records document the methodology. It's teachable to strategic thinkers, creating 4-6x talent cost advantage vs. hiring expensive senior engineers."
