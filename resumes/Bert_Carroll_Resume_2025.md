## Executive Summary

Technology executive with 20+ years building scalable systems across Fortune 500 enterprises and startups. Since October 2024, co-founded Orbiit Recovery and pioneered AI-native development methodology achieving **40-50x cost efficiency** vs. traditional teams. Over the past year (October 2024 – Present), sustained high-velocity execution across multiple simultaneous initiatives: production HIPAA platform, co-founded Substance Use Disorder Foundation (SUDF) and created Digital Recovery Standard (DRS) certification (70% SOC 2/HITRUST overlap), fractional CTO practice, AI Archetypes Assessment, weekly podcast (11 episodes published with AI-generated pages and tools), paid speaking engagements, and 10+ website launches. Built **Signal**—a purpose-built project management platform for coordinating human + AI development teams.

**Strategic Positioning - AI-Native Development:**
- Demonstrated that AI-native development methodology doesn't require traditional software engineering background—leverages strategic thinking, architecture knowledge, and AI orchestration to achieve velocity
- Language-agnostic approach: reads code through AI layer, focuses on system design and business outcomes rather than language-specific implementation details
- Proof: built production HIPAA platform, created Signal, developed FastAPI tools, and coordinated multiple tech stacks (Django, Astro, FastAPI) simultaneously—all through AI-augmented development

**Key Differentiators:**
- **AI-Native Development Infrastructure:** Created Signal to manage distributed AI development teams, achieving sustained 15-20 story points/day velocity (3-4 developer equivalent) with peak performance of 48 points/day
- **Proven Capital Efficiency:** Compressed 6-month development cycles into 3-4 weeks; delivered 200+ story points in 10 weeks with <$500/month operational costs
- **Multi-Initiative Velocity:** Sustained high-velocity output over 12 months across startup co-founding, fractional CTO work, AI assessment development, weekly podcast production, paid speaking, 10+ websites
- **Strategic Technical Leadership:** 23 documented Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) covering security posture, payment architecture, and AI workflow integration—eliminating "CTO as single point of failure" risk
- **Cross-Industry Expertise:** Healthcare (HIPAA), Payments (PCI-DSS), Public Sector, Education—experienced in highly regulated environments
