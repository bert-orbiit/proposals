## Key Talking Points for CEO

When your CEO shares your resume with PE investors, here are the soundbites:

### Primary Narrative
"Bert co-founded Orbiit Recovery in October 2024 after leaving i3 Verticals in September. Over the past year, he built a production-ready HIPAA-compliant patient engagement platform, created Signal—a purpose-built project management system for AI-native development—launched a fractional CTO practice, developed the AI Archetypes Assessment, launched a weekly podcast (11 episodes published), and secured paid speaking engagements. This sustained execution over 12 months proves the AI-augmented development methodology: sustained 15-20 story points/day velocity (3-4 developer equivalent), 200+ story points in 10 weeks, zero production incidents, 95%+ uptime, all while scaling across multiple initiatives simultaneously."

### The 12-Month Execution Story
"Left i3 Verticals September 2024. Started Orbiit Recovery October 2024. Over the past year: production HIPAA platform, Signal project management system, fractional CTO work, AI Archetypes Assessment, weekly podcast with 11 published episodes, paid speaking gigs, 10+ professional websites. All with zero production incidents and sustained high-velocity output across multiple simultaneous initiatives. This isn't just using AI tools—this is AI-native development methodology in action with sustained execution at scale."

### Signal as Competitive Moat
"Signal is purpose-built infrastructure for AI-native development teams. Traditional tools (Jira, Linear) track commits and tickets—Signal tracks story points delivered, session quality ratings, and AI coder performance. Successfully coordinated 3 parallel AI development streams with zero merge conflicts. Potential standalone SaaS product for the emerging AI-native development market."

### Capital Efficiency
"Proven AI-augmented development model: 48 story points delivered in single day (Oct 21, 2025) equivalent to 6-8 traditional developers. Signal dashboard provides institutional visibility eliminating 'black box' concern with AI development—PE can see exactly what's being delivered in real-time."

### De-Risking for PE
"23 Architecture Decision Records document every strategic technical decision with rationale. Automated CI/CD pipeline eliminates tribal knowledge. Multi-tenant architecture with clean separation supports white-label deployment for acquisition targets. This isn't a startup with tech debt—it's exit-ready infrastructure."

## What's NOT in These Resumes (Intentionally)

### Personal Projects/Interests
- Woodworking
- Fountain pens
- Family creative projects (comics, storytelling)

**Why:** Keep professional resume focused on business outcomes. These are great for relationship-building conversations but don't belong in PE due diligence materials.

### Non-Leadership Roles
- Earlier career positions before 2009 (family business, non-profit management, small business owner) are mentioned briefly but not detailed

**Why:** PE investors care about last 10-15 years and leadership trajectory. Earlier roles show career arc but don't need detail.

## Next Steps (If Needed)

### If CEO Wants Word/PDF Format:
I can convert either version to traditional resume format (.docx style) with proper formatting

### If CEO Wants One-Pager:
I can create ultra-concise one-page version focused solely on:
- Orbiit Recovery achievements
- Signal as strategic IP
- AI-native development metrics
- Consulting work (condensed)

### If PE Wants Technical Deep Dive:
Comprehensive version is ready; can also create supplementary technical architecture document if needed

## My Recommendation

**Send Executive Summary Version to CEO with this note:**

> "Attached is 2-page executive resume for PE investor review. Key narrative: Left i3 Verticals Sept 2024, started Orbiit Recovery Oct 2024, and over the past year built production HIPAA platform, created Signal (AI-native project management system), launched fractional CTO practice, developed AI Archetypes Assessment, produced weekly podcast (11 episodes published), and launched 10+ websites. This sustained 12-month execution proves the 40x cost efficiency claim—high-velocity output across multiple initiatives simultaneously with zero production incidents. Comprehensive technical version available if investors want architecture deep dive during due diligence."

**Why This Positioning Works:**

1. **Proves Sustained Execution:** You're not just saying "AI makes me faster"—you're demonstrating sustained velocity over a full year
2. **De-Risks Execution:** Shows you can maintain quality across multiple simultaneous initiatives (Orbiit + consulting + podcast + speaking + websites)
3. **Demonstrates Depth:** Weekly podcast production alongside technical execution shows communication skills and thought leadership
4. **Signals Scalability:** 12 months of sustained output suggests repeatable methodology, not just initial sprint

This positions you as:
1. **Understanding the audience** (PE investors value conciseness)
2. **Strategic thinker** (Signal as IP, not just "we used AI tools")
3. **Proven executor** (12-month track record with measurable outcomes and zero incidents)
4. **Multi-dimensional** (Technical execution + thought leadership + consulting + media production)
5. **Easy to work with** (asking what format CEO prefers)

## Questions for You

1. **Format preference:** Markdown OK or need Word/PDF conversion?
2. **Length preference:** Executive (2 pages) or Comprehensive (8 pages) for initial sharing?
3. **Emphasis:** Want more emphasis on consulting work vs. Orbiit Recovery?
4. **Additional context:** Any specific PE firm background I should know about? (Healthcare-focused? Software-focused? Growth-stage vs. early-stage?)

Let me know if you want adjustments or different format.
