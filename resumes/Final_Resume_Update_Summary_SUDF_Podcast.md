# Final Resume Update Summary
## All Corrections Applied - October 2025

---

## What Changed in This Update

### 1. Removed Technical Jargon ✅
**Before:** References to "ADR-0023" throughout resumes
**After:** Plain language like "documented mobile integration workflow" and "Architecture Decision Records"

**Why:** PE investors don't need specific technical reference numbers—they need to understand the strategic value (eliminating "CTO as single point of failure" risk through documentation).

---

### 2. Upgraded Accelerating Humans Podcast Section ✅

**Before:** Simple description of weekly podcast
**After:** Highlighted as major technical differentiator with two key innovations:

#### Your Role Clarification
- **Co-host & technical guru** (not just co-host)
- Partner handles production
- You build sites, tools, and pages

#### Key Differentiator #1: AI-Generated Episode Pages
- Dedicated page for each podcast episode
- Show notes, resources, and key takeaways
- Generated using AI template

#### Key Differentiator #2: Immediately Implementable Tools
- Tools created for each episode
- Listeners can use AI-powered utilities alongside content

**Why This Matters for PE:** Shows you're not just consuming AI tools—you're building AI-powered content infrastructure that generates both audience AND functional software.

### 3. SUDF Repositioned as Major Achievement ✅

**Before:** Listed under "Recent Projects" as a website
**After:** Featured prominently as **industry standard creation** (comparable to IIBA)

#### What SUDF Really Is

#### Digital Recovery Standard (DRS) Certification

**100-Point Evaluation Framework** across 5 categories:
1. **Regulatory Compliance** (26 points) – HIPAA, 42 CFR Part 2, state regulations, data privacy
2. **Clinical Excellence** (26 points) – Evidence-based practices, clinical protocols, crisis management, staff credentials
3. **Technology Security** (22 points) – Infrastructure, encryption, access controls, incident response
4. **Peer Support** (16 points) – Community moderation, specialist training, user safety
5. **User Experience** (10 points) – Accessibility and person-centered design

**Three Certification Tiers** (Revenue-Generating):
- **Recognized**: 62-77 points | $5K-$8K | 12-month validity
- **Certified**: 78-89 points | $15K-$25K | 18-month validity
- **Accredited**: 90-105 points | $30K-$50K | 24-month validity

**70% Overlap with SOC 2 Type II and HITRUST:**
- Validates your regulatory expertise
- Demonstrates understanding of enterprise compliance requirements
- Positions SUDF as strategic bridge between clinical quality and enterprise security standards

**8-10 Week Assessment Timeline:**
- Documentation review
- Security assessment

#### Why This is MASSIVE for PE Investors

**Industry Positioning:**
- You didn't just build software—you're **establishing professional standards** for an emerging industry
- Comparable to IIBA (International Institute of Business Analysis) establishing credibility standards for Business Analysts
- This is **thought leadership + revenue model**

**Regulatory Expertise:**
- HIPAA, 42 CFR Part 2 (substance abuse confidentiality), state-level compliance
- 70% SOC 2/HITRUST overlap shows you understand enterprise security requirements
- De-risks regulatory concerns for Orbiit Recovery and future ventures

**Revenue Model:**
- Certification fees ($5K-$50K per platform)
- Not just consulting—this is a **scalable certification business**
- Establishes you as authority in digital recovery space

**Market Positioning:**
- Creates credibility standards for digital recovery programs
- Orbiit Recovery can be first platform to achieve DRS Accredited status
- Competitive moat: you're writing the rules for the industry

### 4. Timeline Correction ✅

**Confirmed:** All consulting and fractional work happened in **2025** (not 2020-Present)

**Timeline:**
- **September 2024:** Left i3 Verticals
- **October 2024:** Co-founded Orbiit Recovery
- **October 2024 – October 2025 (12 months):** Everything else

**12-Month Achievement Window:**
- Orbiit Recovery production HIPAA platform (200+ story points, zero incidents)
- Signal AI-native development coordination system
- **Co-founded SUDF and created DRS certification framework**
- College Decoded fractional CTO client
- AI Archetypes Assessment (fly.io + FastAPI)
- **Accelerating Humans Podcast (11 episodes with AI-generated pages and tools)**
- Paid speaking engagements (9-chapter IIBA event)
- 10+ websites launched
- Zero production incidents on owned platform

---

### 5. Platform Clarifications ✅

#### AI Archetypes Location
- **Hosted on:** acceleratinghumans.com (not askthehuman.com)
- **Tech stack:** fly.io + FastAPI
- **Being revamped** to help teams determine AI adoption readiness

#### Production Incidents Context
- **OLD platform (GoHighLevel):** HAD production incidents
- **Strategic decision:** Migrated to Django platform for full code ownership
- **NEW platform (Django):** **Zero incidents since launch**
- **Uptime:** 95%+

#### "Not a Software Engineer" = Competitive Advantage
- **Language-agnostic approach:** Reads code through AI layer
- **Focus:** System design and business outcomes, not language-specific implementation
- **Proof:** Built Django, FastAPI, React, Astro projects simultaneously
- **Why PE should care:** Methodology is teachable to strategic thinkers (4-6x talent cost advantage vs. hiring senior engineers)

## If Asked About:

### "What's SUDF?"
✅ **Say:** "Bert co-founded the Substance Use Disorder Foundation and created a certification standard for digital recovery programs—similar to how IIBA established professional standards for Business Analysts. It's a 100-point evaluation framework covering regulatory compliance (HIPAA, 42 CFR Part 2), clinical excellence, and technology security. Three certification tiers generate $5K-$50K in revenue per platform. The framework has 70% overlap with SOC 2 Type II and HITRUST, which demonstrates both regulatory expertise and strategic market positioning."

### "Had any production incidents?"
✅ **Say:** "We experienced incidents on the vendor platform (GoHighLevel), which led to the strategic decision to migrate to our own Django platform for full code ownership. Since taking code ownership, we've had zero production incidents with 95%+ uptime. The migration demonstrates technical judgment and eliminates vendor dependency risk."

### "Can you scale without Bert?"
✅ **Say:** "Signal makes the methodology repeatable, and 23 Architecture Decision Records document the technical decisions and workflows. The AI-native approach is teachable to strategic thinkers rather than requiring expensive senior engineers—creating a 4-6x talent cost advantage. Bert's also building institutional knowledge through fractional CTO work and speaking engagements, showing the methodology transfers across organizations."

### "What's the podcast about?"
✅ **Say:** "Accelerating Humans is a weekly podcast on contemporary AI issues and remaining human in an AI world. What's unique is Bert builds AI-generated pages for each episode AND creates immediately implementable tools listeners can use alongside the content. It's not just talking about AI—it's shipping working software with every episode. This demonstrates the AI-native development methodology in action: simultaneous content + software production."
